# Django Delights
a Matt Yerkes portoflio project

# Introduction
This was created as an example/learning project for my personal portfolio. Django Delights is an example restaurant web-app built using the Django web framework and hosted on pythonanywhere.com. 

# Usage
As a user (i.e. Customer), you are able to view the menu and place orders for items. To interact with the site as an employee, you must create an account and log in. This allows you to access additional views such as seeing all the orders that have been placed, editing the menu, viewing the available ingredient inventory, and more. These views are secured and cannot be accessed without being logged in.

# Technologies
- python 3.9.5
- django 3.2.3
- PostgreSQL
- django-crispy-forms
